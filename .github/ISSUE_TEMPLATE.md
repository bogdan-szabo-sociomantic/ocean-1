CODE REPOSITORY DEACTIVATED
===========================

This repository has been deactivated, all Ocean development will be now done in
the [Tsunami Ocean public
repository](https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami/ocean).

This repository should be only used to store historic issues and new issues
where sensitive information can't be shared in the public repository.

Before creating any new issues in this repository, please check if there is
a general way to describe the problem that doesn't involve disclosing private
information. If this is the case, please [create an issue in the public
repo](https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami/ocean/issues/new) instead.

If there is no way to remove all sensitive information because is relevant for
the issue, please check if you can split the issue in two: one part describing
the general problem (without private information) and one part with the
private information, like mentioning private repositories, production servers,
etc. If this is the case, please first [create an issue in the public
repo](https://github.com/sociomantic-tsunami/ocean/issues/new) and then create
an issue in this repo linking to the public issue (do not link in the other
direction as we don't want to *leak* private issues in the public repo, which
will also be completely useless for people outside Sociomantic).

If, and only if, there is no way to dissociate the public and private
information, only then you can create one issue in this repo and none in the
public repository.

**NEVER SUBMIT PULL REQUESTS TO THIS REPO**

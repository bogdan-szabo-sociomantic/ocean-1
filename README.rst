``ocean.io.serialize.StructDumper``
  This class is no longer a template, the ``opCall()`` and ``dump()`` methods
  are templates instead. This way you can reuse a single instance of this
  class to dump all kinds of different objects.

  To upgrade you have to remove the template parameter when instantiating the
  class (or referencing the type). Normally the call site for the now templated
  methods don't need to be updated if the template parameter can be correctly
  inferred.

  Note that the new ``BufferedStructDumper`` is the direct equivalent of the old
  ``StructDumper``. The new ``StructDumper`` is a simplified version without an
  internal buffer.

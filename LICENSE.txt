For all practical purposes you can consider this project to be distributed
under Tango 3-Clause BSD License. Bear in mind that some external libraries
used by some modules might have a different license, like GPL. So if you link
to external libraries, please check the license for the libraries you are
linking against.

All files written by Sociomantic Labs GmbH that are free from Tango code are
distributed under a dual license: Tango 3-Clause BSD License and Boost Software
License Version 1.0 too. Almost all files coming from the Tango project[1] have
another dual license: Tango 3-Clause BSD and Academic Free License v3.0. A few
files have MIT license though, but this license is more permissive than
3-Clause BSD, so you should still be able to use all the code under the terms
of the 2-Clause BSD license.

Please consult each file's headers to know the exact licensing options if you
need to use a license other than 3-Clause BSD. Again, if you link against
external libraries, you need to see each individual license for those libraries
to see if more restrictive terms apply.

For the complete license text, please consult the files LICENSE_BSD.txt and
LICENSE_BOOST.txt for Sociomantic files and LICENSE_TANGO.txt for Tango files.
